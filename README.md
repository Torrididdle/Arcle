# Arcle
An implementation of Wordle for the Acorn Archimedes series.

Done using SWI calls as a challenge. Code is pretty messy, Sunday afternoon job and a hack-together from some old RiscOS stuff I've done.

Attempts to find the right word from the system clock. If the clock is un-set or pre-dates the first word then it starts at the beginning (or the one after the last one you've completed if appropriate).
