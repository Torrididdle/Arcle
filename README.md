# Arcle
An implementation of Wordle for the Acorn Archimedes series.

Done using SWI calls as a challenge. Code is pretty messy, Sunday afternoon job and a hack-together from some old RiscOS stuff I've done.

Starts at the very first wordle, will move forwards as you get them right. No date handling etc yet.
